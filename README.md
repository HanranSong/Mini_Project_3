# Mini_Project_3

## Description
The Memory game has appeared in many different contexts, either as a computer game or as a card game that uses a partial or full deck of playing cards. The player tries to find two matching tiles by selecting tiles from a rectangular grid. This game also appeared as a popular American TV show called Concentration. We will create a single person game that tracks the score of the player as the time taken to complete the game, where a lower score is better. Multiple players can take turns playing the game and compete by comparing their scores.
